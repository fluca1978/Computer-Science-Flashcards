The product owner can influence the stories to be put into the sprint backlog as follows

- by reducing the scope of a story
- splitting a story into smaller stories
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are some differences between story and task?</summary>

A **story** is what the product owner cares about, it is a description of a new feature. 

A **task** is one of the things to be done in order to develop a story. 
        
For example a story could be "create a new query use function".

The tasks for that story could be
1. design the UI
2. write unit tests
3. create a new database query

<summary>What is a burndown chart? What are the warning signs from it?</summary>

It could have the following warning signs:
- actual line is over the diagonal => need to remove stories from the backlog
- actual line is under the diagonal => need to add stories from the backlog
